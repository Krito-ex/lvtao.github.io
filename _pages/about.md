I am a third year undergrate student from [the School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). My research interests include computational photography/videography, computer vision, machine learning and computer graphics.

My research interests focus on the compact design of high-dimensional signal acquisition systems with computational imaging theory at its core, as well as image processing tasks related to high-dimensional vision.

In high-dimensional signal acquisition, I introduced a novel snapshot imaging spectrometer with aperture diffraction (ICCV 2023) and investigated its parallel architecture (submitted to CVPR 2024). I am committed to researching affordable snapshot acquisition of spectral data on mobile devices. Expanding on this work, I am currently delving into the development of a snapshot spectral and depth imaging system with aperture diffraction, a passive and compact ultrafast spectral video imaging system with helical encoding, as well as a compact light field spectral imaging system based on chromatic polarization.

In the field of  high-dimensional vision, I created a dataset and benchmark for detecting gas targets in the mid-wave and long-wave infrared band, showcased at CVPR 2022. I played a key role in developing a spectral video gas monitoring and early warning system, leading to top honors in three national competitions, where I served as the project lead for two. Furthermore, my research extends to applying artificial intelligence for improved chemical industry safety, earning me the Best Demo Award at the CAAI International Conference on AI.
